# user-defined keywords may be placed in this file
# these keywords do not affect parsing or SDL; they are only used by the editor
# for syntax highlighting and keyword completion (i.e. ctl-space or tab)
#
# the syntax is one keyword per line. spaces are not permitted within keywords
# (leading or trailing spaces are allowed but will be stripped). any line containing
# more than one token will be ignored, as well any line starting with a '#'.
